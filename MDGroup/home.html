          <p> <strong>MDabroad´s</strong> assistance services are multi-faceted,
            many travelers are rarely prepared for illness while
            abroad for work and pleasure. Furthermore, they are
            unable to predict the many challenges they will face
            when navigating through foreign medical systems. <br><br>
            This places travelers in a highly vulnerable position
            with regard to their medical well-being, both in
            minor and complex medical conditions. It is critical
            to manage health conditions appropriately and in a
            timely manner to minimize risk and costs while
            traveling abroad. <br><br>
            The ability to respond to these risks can make all the
            difference between reasonable and customary
            charges and grossly inflated charges. md abroad
            offers comprehensive assistance Services which
            ensure immediate access to medical guidance and
            care. <br><br>
            <strong> MDabroad´s</strong> can assist travelers all over the
            globe with an exclusive network of the most highly
            credentialed providers, for both outpatient and
            inpatient care. <strong>MDabroad</strong> offers unique packages
            to support the unique needs of travelers in any part
            of the world. Our integrated packages include travel
            assistance Services before, during, and upon return.
            We extend travel preparation Services, so they are
            informed of potential health risks prior to travel

          <p>
            <strong> MDabroad</strong> was founded in 2000 with a specific
            aim: to bridge the gaps between insurers and
            medical providers in the Americas.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>MDabroad </strong> offers comprehensive and customized
            services to meet the distinctive requirements of two
            main groups: healthcare insurers, traveler’s
            assistance companies and third-party administrators
            (TPAs) and healthcare providers
          </p>
          <p>With its headquarters in Miami, Florida and a
            highly-trained exclusive service center in Buenos
            Aires, Argentina, we developed a network of
            medical providers while we began providing
            services for world-class insurance and traveler’s
            assistance companies. </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, <strong>MDabroad</strong> has developed a
            role of unquestionable leadership in the healthcare
            industry as the first facilitator for the financial needs
            of international health industry payers and hospitals
            and medical services providers in general.
          </p>
          <p>Since 2000, we have managed over $1 billion
            dollars in the settlement of medical claims between
            insurers and healthcare.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>Our formula is simple: We strive to be a reliable
            partner</p>
          <p>
            <strong> MDabroad </strong> sits in the middle of each transaction
            and keeps each party honest. We constantly
            innovate and provide cutting edge technological
            solutions to ease communication barriers, allow for
            transparency and to provide reliable information in
            the quickest manner possible
          </p>

          <p>
            Payers, hospitals, and physicians work mainly with
            local healthcare clients with the same languages,
            cultural norms in familiar regional medical systems.
            But significant differences can arise when dealing
            with foreign hospitals
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, a Latin American hospital may find the
            collections process challenging when an insurance
            company from a completely different region is
            involved. These challenges may hinder a proper
            understanding between each party which resulting
            in delays and different issues when it comes to the
            settlement of any given claim. <strong>MDabroad </strong>
            identified this unique need and meticulously crafted
            an innovative solution that facilitates the most
            effective payment, ensuring both the payers and the
            providers are satisfied.

            Our tools allow providers to communicate specific
            information to appropriate ICD and CPT codes
            which allows insurers to more easily identify
            excluded events up front, such as pre-existing
            conditions and certain non-covered medical items,
            such as certain medical devices and hospital
